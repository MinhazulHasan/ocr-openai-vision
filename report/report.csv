Mr. Foot's line will be that as Labour OM Ps opposed the Govern ment Bill which brought life peers into existence, they should not now put forward nominees. He believes that the House of Lords should be abolished and that Labour should not take any steps which would appear to ""prop up"" an out-dated institution.

There are bound to be demonstrations."" Yesterday Sir Roy's chief aide, Mr. Julius Greenfield, telephoned his chief a report on his talks with Mr. Macmillan at Chequers.

These plans do not give the Africans the overall majority they are seeking. African delegates are studying them today. The conference will meet to discuss the function of a proposed House of Chiefs.

African delegates to the talks yesterday called on Mr. Macmillan to cease his negotiations with Sir Roy's representative, Mr. Julius Greenfield. He was at Chequers last week-end. They said they regarded with ""growing anger"" the ""gross and unconstitutional"" interference by Sir Roy's Federal Government in the talks.

He believed he would perform ""outstanding service"" in his post. Senator Robertson's committee has to pass Mr. Weaver's nomination before it can be considered by the full Senate.

The President will probably discuss the
problem with Dr. Brentano, the West
German Foreign Minister, who is due in
Washington next week. A big slice of
Germany's ""aid"" is the early payment
of a 210 million debt to America. United
States officials quickly point out that
this is money due to America anyway.

And he has abandoned plans to visit President de Gaulle this month to smooth the way.

When an advertisement contains statements whose factual truth is doubtful, or where the total content would be deeply repugnant to our readers, it is right to exercise editorial discretion. The MRA advertisement falls into neither category, though many readers will dislike it.
